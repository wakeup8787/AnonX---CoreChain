AnonX Whitepaper

Version 1.1 – Open Community Draft
Introduction

AnonX is a private, fast, and legal crypto payment infrastructure for a post-cash world.

    It is not a hype project.

    It is not made for speculation.

    It is a tool for everyday people to make payments with privacy.

What is AnonX?

AnonX is a custom blockchain built on Substrate, designed for real-world, private payments.

    AX is the native, non-inflationary token

    Payments via simple mobile/desktop app (NFC/QR)

    Merchants receive fiat currency instantly

    No trading/exchange inside the app—only wallet top-up (not trading)

Access to AX

    AX will be available on public exchanges for free trading.

    In the AnonX app, users can top up AX up to $5,000 USD/month without KYC.

    To exceed this limit, KYC is required for the next top-up only.

    No registration or user data required for app use.

How AnonX Works

    Wallet Creation

        Visit the encrypted AnonX platform—unique QR code/token is generated using the latest TLS/encryption.

        Scan the QR code (mobile) or copy the token (desktop) to generate a wallet—no registration, no central storage, fully anonymous.

    Buy AX

        Acquire AX on a public exchange or through the app’s fiat on-ramp (up to $5,000/month without KYC).

    Make Payments

        Pay with AX using QR/NFC in the app.

        The system instantly converts AX to fiat (e.g., EUR, PLN) for the merchant via the AnonX/Fiat bridge (e.g., ZEN).

    Merchant Receives Fiat

        Merchant uses a registered business wallet—receives legal fiat payouts.

Privacy Model
Element	Status	Notes
Wallet creation	Fully private	Local, QR/token-based, no user data
Sender identity	Public	Visible in blockchain explorer
Receiver identity	Hidden	Encrypted, stealth address/zk-SNARK planned
Transaction amount	Public	Always visible
Merchant wallet	Registered	Transparent and legal
Technology

    Substrate-based blockchain fork

    AX as native, non-inflationary token (no inflation, fixed supply or governance)

    anonx_tx pallet: simple payment logic

    stealth_zk pallet: stealth payment structure

    zk-SNARK integration planned (Groth16/Circom/Halo2)

User Flow

1. Visit AnonX (web/app) ➜ 2. Get QR/token ➜ 3. App creates local wallet (no data stored) ➜ 4. Buy AX (up to $5k/month, no KYC) ➜ 5. Pay in-store via QR/NFC ➜ 6. Instant AX→fiat conversion for merchant ➜ 7. If topping up above $5k/month: KYC required only for top-up, not for app use

Legal Note

    AX is not a currency. The AnonX platform does not store user data and does not provide exchange/trading services.

Roadmap
Phase	Objective
Alpha	AX token + testnet
Devnet	Wallet + stealth address scaffold
Beta	Legal fiat payouts for merchants
v1.0	Mobile wallet + QR/NFC + fiat bridge
For Developers

We invite:

    Rust/Substrate developers

    ZK cryptographers

    Wallet/frontend engineers (Flutter, JS, NFC)

    Backend devs for bridge/legal modules

No identity needed—just good code. Contact via GitHub issues/discussions.
What AnonX is NOT

    Not an exchange

    Not a laundering tool

    Not a trading coin

    Not for the dark web

Conclusion

Privacy is not a feature — it’s a right.

AnonX exists to provide anonymous, legal payments for ordinary people in a system where cash is disappearing. It’s about offering a choice.

You don’t need an identity to be honest.

Manifesto: AnonX

Privacy. Freedom. Instant Exchange. For people, not profit.

AnonX is not a company. It’s a movement.

It’s an answer to a world where every payment is tracked, sold, blocked.

It’s a protest against digital surveillance, financial censorship, and closed systems.

We’re not another token.
We don’t promise “to the moon.”
We’re not here for investors.
We’re here for free people who want to pay anywhere, anyhow—without permission.

What is AnonX?

    AnonX is an instant transaction currency, made for everyday payments.

    Conversion to local fiat happens automatically at checkout.

    Full anonymity—no data, no logins, no traces.

    Encrypted P2P network—no middlemen, no central servers.

    Open-source, transparent, community-driven.

Our Beliefs:

    Privacy is a right—not a luxury.

    Money is freedom of choice—not a tool of control.

    Technology should serve people—not governments or corporations.

    Real change starts with community, not VC funds.
