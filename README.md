**AnonX Manifesto**

**Privacy. Freedom. Instant exchange. For the people – not for profit.*

---

**AnonX is not a company. It’s a movement.**
It’s a response to a world where every payment is tracked, sold, and censored.
It’s a rebellion against digital surveillance, financial gatekeeping, and closed systems.

We are not just another token.
We don’t promise “to the moon.”
We’re not building this for investors.
We’re building it for **free people** who want to pay anyone, anywhere, anytime – without permission.

**What is AnonX?**

* **AnonX is an ultra-fast transactional currency** built for everyday payments.
* **Instant conversion to local currencies** (e.g., EUR, USD, PLN) happens at the point of sale.
* **Fully anonymous** – no data, no login, no tracking.
* **Encrypted peer-to-peer network**, with no central servers or gatekeepers.
* **Open-source, transparent, community-driven.**

---

**What we believe:**

* Privacy is not a luxury – it’s a right.
* Money is a tool for freedom – not for control.
* Technology should serve people – not governments or corporations.
* Real change doesn’t start with VC funding – it starts with a community.

---

**What we’re building:**

* The AnonX wallet with QR/NFC payments.
* The AnonX token – ultra-fast, lightweight, permissionless.
* A system for automatic fiat/stablecoin conversion at checkout.
* Plugins for online and offline stores.
* A platform with no borders, no censorship, and no compromises.

---

**Who we need:**

* Developers: Rust, Solidity, frontend/backend builders.
* Crypto and privacy enthusiasts.
* Designers, translators, meme warriors.
* Anyone who believes in financial freedom.

**No permission needed. Join us.**
